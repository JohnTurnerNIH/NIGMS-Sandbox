# Selecting a Kernel in a Notebook 

Jupyter lab allows you to select different kernels depending on what language is needed for script. Changing the kernel will restart the notebook and is helpful when needing to change coding languages to execute code in the new language. 

## 1) In Jupyter lab within a Jupyter notebook, click on upper right hand corner of the notebook (usually labeled R or Python).
