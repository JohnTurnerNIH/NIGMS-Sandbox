### Google Cloud Platform resources

1. **IAM - https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview** \
IAM in GCP allows you to manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource. In IAM, permission to access a resource isn't granted directly to the end user. Instead, permissions are grouped into roles, and roles are granted to authenticated principals. 

> ⭐ A **principal** can be a Google Account (for end users), a service account (for applications and compute workloads), a Google group, or a Google Workspace account or Cloud Identity domain that can access a resource. Each principal has its own identifier, which is typically an email address. \
> ⭐ A **role** is a collection of permissions. Permissions determine what operations are allowed on a resource. When you grant a role to a principal, you grant all the permissions that the role contains. \
> ⭐ The allow **policy** is a collection of role bindings that bind one or more principals to individual roles. When you want to define who (principal) has what type of access (role) on a resource, you create an allow policy and attach it to the resource. \

2. **Billing - https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs**
To use Google Cloud services, you must have a valid Cloud Billing account, and must link it to your Google Cloud projects. Your project's Google Cloud usage is charged to the linked Cloud Billing account. When you sign up for NIH CloudLab (https://cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/) you will access an account loaded with credits for you to experiment with.
