# Getting Started with NIGMS Sandbox

Welcome to the NIGMS Sandbox! We wrote this getting started guide to give you the key things you need to know to start using the Sandbox modules. A lot of the documentation here comes from the [NIH Cloud Lab](https://scan.cloud.nih.gov/resources/cloudlab/google-cloud-jumpstart/) GitHub respository, so feel free to visit that page for more info as well. 

### 1. Request an account. 
Step one is to request an account from [here](LINK).
Your account will be provisioned within XYS Hours. You will also receive an onboarding email that will have a link to access your Google Project. 

### 2. Access your Google Cloud Project.
Step two is to access your Google Cloud Project. Navigate to `https://console.cloud.google.com/` and then you need to navigate to your project. 
[Check out our guide](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP/blob/main/docs/open_GCP_project.md) in case you do not see your project right away.

### 3. Open a VertexAI environment to launch a Jupyter Lab environment. 
We show you how [here](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP/blob/main/docs/vertexai.md). 

### 4. Clone desired GitHub repositories and start using the module notebooks. 
- Visit the main [READme](https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox/blob/main/README.md#available-modules) for this repository to get the links to the available modules.
- Navigate to a given repository and [clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) into your VertexAI environment.
