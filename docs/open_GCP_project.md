# How to open your GCP Project

1. Start by going to `console.cloud.google.com`. Make sure the correct Google Profile is showing in the top right, sometimes your browser will open with your personal Google account instead of your academic credentials.

2. Now select (A) the project name at the top middle of the screen. In the box that pops up, make sure that (B) NIH.gov is selected as your organization. Under that, select (C) `All` rather than `Recent`. Then click your (D) Project, and click **Open** in the bottom right.
