# Creating a New Terminal Console in Jupyter Lab

Jupyter lab allows you to create a new console window within its layout. This is also possible on Jupyter lab on AWS SageMaker. Adding a terminal console window where there is a jupyter notebook tab is helpful when needing to run command line code. 

## 1) In Jupyter lab within a jupyter notebook, right click on any whitespace in the jupyter notebook.

## 3) Select the + sign next to the new console you just made. This will open up a new launcher tab.

## 4) Select Terminal under the Other section when selecting the type of launcher.

This new console window can be dragged to fit elsewhere on the screen and create the desired visual.
